At [RAZRLAB](https://razrlab.com), we always keep security at the upmost importance and a simple way to ensure that your IoT devices and your server are securely communicating is to leverage the concept of Mutual TLS Authentication.

# What is Mutual TLS Authentication?

Mutual TLS authentication is a process that ensures that traffic between entities is secure and trusted in both directions between a client and a server. It essentially takes place through a TSL handshake.

This takes place with a root certificate authority (CA) which essentially allows only requests from the devices with a corresponding client certificate issued for it. When a client request reaches the server, the server responds with a request for the client to present its certificate. If the client fails to present the request is not allowed to process, but if it does have a certificate a key exchange takes place for verification.

Mainly two things happen in this process:

- The client will validate that the server is trusted to serve up content for the given configured DNS name
- The server will also validate the client is known by the CA and will authenticate it.

The process will ensure that both parties (client and server) are verified by each other and therefore, mutual authentication takes place and both parties end up trusting each other.

Uff.... now that we have taken the theory out of the way, let's see how we can quickly setup a Mutual TLS Authenticated client and server setup.

# How to setup Mutual TLS Authentication

## Pre-requisites

We are going to use `openssl` to generate certificates, hence, we will need a computer to have the package available.

Check if you have `openssl` on your system by using the following command on your terminal:

```bash
openssl version -a
```

If you don't have `openssl` use the following links to it up on your system:

- To install on Linux (Ubuntu) [click here](https://cloudwafer.com/blog/installing-openssl-on-ubuntu-16-04-18-04/)
- To install on Windows [click here](https://stackoverflow.com/a/51378493/3779309)
- To install/update on Mac using Homebrew [click here](https://medium.com/@katopz/how-to-upgrade-openssl-8d005554401)

## Generate a Certificate Authority (CA)

Run the following command to generate keys for certificate authority (CA)

```bash
openssl req -new -x509 -days 9999 -keyout ca-key.pem -out ca-crt.pem
```

You'll need to fill in the following prompts:

- You'll be asked to insert CA password. Input a preferred password that you'll remember.
- You'll be prompted to specify a CA Common Name. Insert that you prefer like `root.localhost` or `ca.localhost`.

The CA Common Name must be different for both server and client.

## Generate a Server Certificate

First we start with generating key for the server

```bash
openssl genrsa -out server-key.pem 4096
```

Now, generate a Server Certificate Signing Request

```bash
openssl req -new -key server-key.pem -out server-csr.pem
```

You'll need to fill the in the following prompts:

- You'll be prompted to specify a CA Common Name. Insert that you prefer like `localhost` or `server.localhost`.
- Optionally insert a challenge password

The client will need to verify the Common Name, so make sure you have a valid DNS name for this.

Now sign the certificate using the Certificate Authority

```bash
openssl x509 -req -days 9999 -in server-csr.pem -CA ca-crt.pem -CAkey ca-key.pem -CAcreateserial -out server-crt.pem
```

You'll be prompted to insert the password for the Certificate Authority (CA).

Seems like you have successfully generate your Server Certificate, you can verify the certificate using the following command:

```bash
openssl verify -CAfile ca-crt.pem server-crt.pem
```

## Generate a Client Certificate

Once again, we start with generating key for the Client

```bash
openssl genrsa -out client1-key.pem 4096
```

Now, generate a Client Certificate Signing Request

```bash
openssl req -new -key client1-key.pem -out client1-csr.pem
```

You'll need to fill the in the following prompts:

- You'll be prompted to specify a CA Common Name. Insert that you prefer like `client.localhost`. The server should not verify this, since it should not do a reverse DNS lookup.
- Optionally insert a challenge password

Now sign the certificate using the Certificate Authority

```bash
openssl x509 -req -days 9999 -in client1-csr.pem -CA ca-crt.pem -CAkey ca-key.pem -CAcreateserial -out client1-crt.pem
```

You'll be prompted to insert the password for the Certificate Authority (CA).

Now, that you have successfully generated your Client Certificate, you can verify the certificate using the following command:

```bash
openssl verify -CAfile ca-crt.pem client1-crt.pem
```

Now, you can use the keys to perform Mutually Authenticated communication between your client and the server.

I have also setup an example repository using Node.js-based clients and server leveraging Mutual TLS Authentication to send messages. [Click here](https://github.com/zubair1024/mutual-tls-authentication) to view the repository.
